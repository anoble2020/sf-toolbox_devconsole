## Connecting a Salesforce Org

sf toolbox dev console provides two primary methods for connecting to your Salesforce org: through a Chrome extension or by logging in directly via the application interface.

### Method 1: Using the Chrome Extension

1. **Install the Extension**: First, ensure that the SF Toolbox Chrome extension is installed and enabled in your browser.

2. **Access Salesforce**: Navigate to your Salesforce instance in the Chrome browser.

3. **Activate the Toolbox**: Once on the Salesforce page, the SF Toolbox icon should appear in the global actions list. Click the icon to activate the toolbox features directly within Salesforce.

4. **Authenticate**: The extension will automatically handle authentication using your current Salesforce session, allowing you to access the toolbox features seamlessly.

### Method 2: Direct Login via Application

1. **Navigate to the Auth Page**: Open the SF Toolbox Dev Console application and navigate to the authentication page.

2. **Choose Domain**: Choose to connect either a sandbox or production org, or optionally input your custom Salesforce domain in the format `my-domain.my.salesforce.com`

3. **Authentication Process**: The application will check for existing authentication tokens. If none are found, it will redirect you to the Salesforce login page to authenticate.
